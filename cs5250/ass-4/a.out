CS5250: Assignment 4 - memory management.
This simple application gives you a unique set of parameters
for your assignment 4 based on your student number.
To begin, please input your student number.
> Student number read is: A0184588J

The file 'A0184588J-assign4-input.dat' has been created. It is your input for Assignment 4.

This file contains the input that your buddy-clock list simulator is to process.
It is uniquely generated based on your Student ID.
The same Student ID should result in the same file generated.

Each line is a single page transaction. Each line consists of 3 field separated by a tab.
   A <seqno> <num> - allocated <num> physical page frames. We name this allocation as <seqno>.
   X <seqno> <num> - An access to the <num> frame of allocation <seqno>.
   F <seqno> <num> - Deallocate the <num> frame of allocation <seqno>.
Key assumptions:
   1. If a free is attempted on a frame that has been evicted, just ignore.
   2. If an access is attempted on a frame that has been evicted, must treat as a page fault,
      and reallocate a physical page frame for it.
See the assignment description for more details.
Good luck!
